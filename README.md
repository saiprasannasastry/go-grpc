# go-grpc
The code to insert values into db has been taken from [resp-api-using-go](https://github.com/saiprasannasastry/rest-api-using-go)
This was just created for me to try out grpc,
The server code is in cmd/server
client code is in cmd/client
I have implemented to calls, list a particualr album and all albums, both are inside the same method. 
If you wish to have to seperate methods, just modify the test file inside cmd/server
